The purpose of this initiative is to ensure TBEP delivers equitable and fair access to the benefits from environmental programs for all communities.\nWe have created this webpage to increase transparency and reproducibility of the approach guiding our Equity Strategy. We have provided instructions for downloading, cleaning, and analyzing the data that will be used to identify underserved and overburdened communities in Tampa Bay. The methods described on the subsequent pages are presented in R coding language, but users who prefer working with GIS software (e.g., ArcGIS or QGIS) should also be able to reproduce the maps by following along in the descriptions of each step.\nUPDATE: In 2025, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed all data we rely on for mapping underserved and overburdened communities in Tampa Bay, including EJScreen and CEJST. The methods described on this site have now been updated to reflect this change, which requires the user to download archived copies of these datasets from third party sources. TBEP has created archived copies of the national 2022 EJScreen and CEJST 2.0 datasets thanks to the Harvard Dataverse, which are available for direct download from a Dropbox link.

    "text": "What do we consider?\nTo identify underserved communities in Tampa Bay, we are guided by recommendations provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as our own local knowledge and experience with the diverse population of more than 3 million people across the Tampa Bay watershed.\nThe 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), as implemented by EPA through the National Estuary Programs (NEPs), provides approximately $909,800 in annual funding to each NEP over 2022-2026. EPA has a goal to ensure that at least 40% of the benefits from BIL-funded projects during this period will flow to underserved (or disadvantaged) communities across all NEPs.\nThe EPA uses the EJScreen Supplemental Demographic Index to identify disadvantaged communities. The Index is based on an average of the following five demographic variables:\n\nPercent classified as low income\nPercent unemployed\nPercent linguistically isolated (i.e., limited English speaking)\nPercent with less than a high school education\nPercent with low life expectancy\n\nTBEP applies a more inclusive definition of underserved communities to identify opportunities for increasing environmental justice throughout the watershed. For this broader definition, we define “underserved” communities as those that fall within the 80th percentile (or higher) nationally for two or more of the five demographic variables listed above.\nAdditionally, our Equity Strategy recognizes the importance of tailoring TBEP’s environmental programs to address the most significant challenges facing different underserved communities in Tampa Bay. In an effort to promote environmental justice within our region, our approach also characterizes underserved communities according to the unique burdens they are facing that could realistically be mitigated by TBEP activities. We define “overburdened” communities as those that fall within the 80th percentile (or higher) nationally for one or more of the following 12 environmental justice issues:\n\nClimate change: projected agricultural loss, projected flood risk\nNature deprivation: lack of green space\nAir pollution: PM2.5, traffic proximity/volume\nWater pollution: wastewater discharge\nOther pollution: hazardous waste facilities, underground storage tank release, Superfund sites, brownfield sites, phosphate mines\nLegacy effects: historic underinvestment/redlining"

In line with the goals of the Justice40 Initiative, TBEP’s Equity Strategy has a goal to ensure that at least 40% of the benefits from BIL-funded activities are distributed to underserved communities.\nRecognizably, there are a myriad of benefits that flow from the diverse conservation, restoration, research, and outreach activities that TBEP produces, spanning the many provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural services provided by nature. While we support ongoing efforts to develop additional methodologies to quantify these unique services provided by different activities, TBEP considers the following factors when defining and measuring the flow of benefits from our BIL-funded activities for each fiscal year:\nThere are two restoration themes that BIL funds will contribute to:\nProjects within these two themes provide both local and downstream benefits to communities reliant on the ecosystem services provided by Tampa Bay’s extensive network of tributaries, canals, and other waterways. Therefore, for a BIL-funded project to benefit an underserved community (and thus contribute toward our equity target), it must meet the following criteria:\nConsideration of these metrics relative to all BIL-funded projects will inform TBEP’s progress toward the 40% target. Notably, these metrics are based on projects with physical locations and represent indicators of distributive equity only. Additional metrics will be developed in the future that can apply to other types of projects (including research, outreach, and education) and measure progress toward procedural and recognitional equity.\nBelow, we have provided an example of how we can utilize the maps of underserved communities to estimate progress toward achieving the 40% distributive equity target by generating a baseline of the equitable nature of TBEP habitat projects over the previous 5 years.\nLoad the required R packages (install first as needed).\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(leafsync)\nLoad the map of underserved communities and drainage basins that will guide BIL-funded projects.\nload(file = 'data/underserved_tract.RData')\nload(file = 'data/underserved_dbasins.RData')\n\n# project to EPSG 6443 (Florida West) and keep only those meeting underserved definition\nunderserved_tract &lt;- underserved_tract %&gt;%\n  filter(underserved == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 6443)\nunderserved_dbasins &lt;- underserved_dbasins %&gt;%\n  filter(pct_under &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 6443)"

We can see that the projects are adjacent to the main tributary of the drainage basin, but the underserved community is located upstream of the projects. This projects will therefore not contribute direct benefits to the nearby underserved community.\nFinally, there is a project in South St. Petersburg (ID 270) adjacent to Lake Maggiore. In this case, we can see that the benefits provided to the lake can be expected to flow downstream to a couple underserved communities north of the lake.\nKeep only the project with expected benefits to downstream underserved communities and include the number of communities benefiting (2).\n\nsummariesdb &lt;- summariesdb %&gt;%\n  filter(ID == 270) %&gt;%\n  mutate(communities_downstream = 2)\n\n# merge with NEPORT dataset\nbaseline5yr &lt;- left_join(baseline5yr, summariesdb, by = 'ID') %&gt;%\n  mutate(communities_downstream = coalesce(communities_downstream, 0),\n         communities_1mile = coalesce(communities_1mile.x, 0),\n         underserved_communities = ifelse(communities_1mile &gt; 0 | communities_downstream &gt; 0, \"Yes\", \"No\"),\n         Year = Year.x,\n         Total_Project_Costs = Total_Proj.x,\n         EPA320_Costs = EPA_Sectio.x) %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  select(ID, Year, Total_Project_Costs, EPA320_Costs, communities_1mile, communities_downstream, underserved_communities)\n\nGet annual summaries for our measures of distributive equity.\n\nequitystats_annual &lt;- as.data.frame(baseline5yr) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, underserved_communities) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Projects_N = n(),\n            Project_Costs = sum(Total_Project_Costs),\n            Section320_Funds = sum(EPA320_Costs))\n\ntotalstats_annual &lt;- equitystats_annual %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(All_Projects = sum(Projects_N),\n            All_Project_Costs = sum(Project_Costs),\n            All_Section320_Funds = sum(Section320_Funds))\n# by year\nbaselinestats_annual &lt;- left_join(equitystats_annual, totalstats_annual, by = 'Year') %&gt;%\n  mutate(Pct_Projects = Projects_N/All_Projects * 100,\n         Pct_Project_Costs = Project_Costs/All_Project_Costs * 100,\n         Pct_Section320_Funds = coalesce(Section320_Funds/All_Section320_Funds * 100, 0),) %&gt;%\n  filter(underserved_communities == \"Yes\")\n\n# over entire period\nbaselinestats_5yr &lt;- baselinestats_annual %&gt;%\n  group_by(underserved_communities) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Projects_N = sum(Projects_N),\n            Project_Costs = sum(Project_Costs),\n            Section320_Funds = sum(Section320_Funds),\n            All_Projects = sum(All_Projects),\n            All_Project_Costs = sum(All_Project_Costs),\n            All_Section320_Funds = sum(All_Section320_Funds)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Pct_Projects = Projects_N/All_Projects * 100,\n         Pct_Project_Costs = Project_Costs/All_Project_Costs * 100,\n         Pct_Section320_Funds = Section320_Funds/All_Section320_Funds * 100)\n\nIf we look at the table for the entire 5 year period, we can see that 30% of habitat projects provided benefits to underserved communities.
