EPA has a goal to ensure that at least 40% of the benefits from BIL-funded projects during this period will flow to underserved (or disadvantaged) communities across all NEPs.\nThe EPA uses the EJScreen Supplemental Demographic Index to identify disadvantaged communities. The Index is based on an average of the following five demographic variables:\n\nPercent classified as low income\nPercent unemployed\nPercent linguistically isolated (i.e., limited English speaking)\nPercent with less than a high school education\nPercent with low life expectancy\n\nTBEP applies a more inclusive definition of underserved communities to identify opportunities for increasing environmental justice throughout the watershed. For this broader definition, we define “underserved” communities as those that fall within the 80th percentile (or higher) nationally for two or more of the five demographic variables listed above.\nAdditionally, our Equity Strategy recognizes the importance of tailoring TBEP’s environmental programs to address the most significant challenges facing different underserved communities in Tampa Bay. In an effort to promote environmental justice within our region, our approach also characterizes underserved communities according to the unique burdens they are facing that could realistically be mitigated by TBEP activities. We define “overburdened” communities as those that fall within the 80th percentile (or higher) nationally for one or more of the following 12 environmental justice issues:\n\nClimate change: projected agricultural loss, projected flood risk\nNature deprivation: lack of green space\nAir pollution: PM2.5, traffic proximity/volume\nWater pollution: wastewater discharge\nOther pollution: hazardous waste facilities, underground storage tank release, Superfund sites, brownfield sites, phosphate mines\nLegacy effects: historic underinvestment/redlining"

We prefer to work from the higher resolution tracts (EJScreen), so we need to make sure, for each EJScreen tract, we pull the relevant data from the CEJST tract. Notably, some of the resulting tract data may not be entirely accurate, as percentiles may apply to the larger CEJST tract but not necessarily to the tracts as split by the EJScreen data.

In line with the goals of the Justice40 Initiative, TBEP’s Equity Strategy has a goal to ensure that at least 40% of the benefits from BIL-funded activities are distributed to underserved communities.\nRecognizably, there are a myriad of benefits that flow from the diverse conservation, restoration, research, and outreach activities that TBEP produces, spanning the many provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural services provided by nature. While we support ongoing efforts to develop additional methodologies to quantify these unique services provided by different activities, TBEP considers the following factors when defining and measuring the flow of benefits from our BIL-funded activities for each fiscal year:\nThere are two restoration themes that BIL funds will contribute to:\nProjects within these two themes provide both local and downstream benefits to communities reliant on the ecosystem services provided by Tampa Bay’s extensive network of tributaries, canals, and other waterways. Therefore, for a BIL-funded project to benefit an underserved community (and thus contribute toward our equity target), it must meet the following criteria:\nConsideration of these metrics relative to all BIL-funded projects will inform TBEP’s progress toward the 40% target. Notably, these metrics are based on projects with physical locations and represent indicators of distributive equity only. Additional metrics will be developed in the future that can apply to other types of projects (including research, outreach, and education) and measure progress toward procedural and recognitional equity.\nBelow, we have provided an example of how we can utilize the maps of underserved communities to estimate progress toward achieving the 40% distributive equity target by generating a baseline of the equitable nature of TBEP habitat projects over the previous 5 years.\nLoad the required R packages (install first as needed).\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(mapview)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(leafsync)\nLoad the map of underserved communities and drainage basins that will guide BIL-funded projects.\nload(file = 'data/underserved_tract.RData')\nload(file = 'data/underserved_dbasins.RData')\n\n# project to EPSG 6443 (Florida West) and keep only those meeting underserved definition\nunderserved_tract &lt;- underserved_tract %&gt;%\n  filter(underserved == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 6443)\nunderserved_dbasins &lt;- underserved_dbasins %&gt;%\n  filter(pct_under &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 6443)"

This projects will therefore not contribute direct benefits to the nearby underserved community.\nFinally, there is a project in South St. Petersburg (ID 270) adjacent to Lake Maggiore.

Such maps can help us identify where we can direct future efforts to more equitably distribute the benefits of TBEP activities across the watershed.\n\nunder_over_summary1 &lt;- under_over_projects %&gt;%\n  group_by(ID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Projects_N = sum(Projects_N),\n            Project_Costs = sum(Project_Costs))\n\nprojectmap &lt;- mapview(under_over_summary1, zcol = \"Projects_N\", layer.name = \"No. of Projects\")\ninvestmentmap &lt;- mapview(under_over_summary1, zcol = \"Project_Costs\", layer.name = \"Investment Dollars\")\n\nsync(projectmap, investmentmap)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental burdens facing these underserved communities\nWe can also look at the burdens facing the underserved communities that have benefited from these past projects. For example, the graph generated below shows how frequently TBEP habitat projects have benefited underserved communities facing pollution and other environmental justice issues. We can see that the majority of underserved communities benefiting from past TBEP projects have a high density of leaking underground storage tanks, are in close proximity to brownfields, and have higher risks of flooding under climate change.\n\nunder_over_burdens &lt;- under_over_benefits %&gt;%\n  select(ID, thresholdEJ_agloss, thresholdEJ_floodr, thresholdEJ_greens, thresholdEJ_pm2.5, thresholdEJ_trafic, thresholdEJ_wastew, \n         thresholdEJ_hwaste, thresholdEJ_ugtank, thresholdEJ_sfunds, thresholdEJ_redlin, thresholdEJ_phmine, thresholdEJ_bfield) %&gt;%\n  melt(id.vars = \"ID\", variable.name = \"Burden\", value.name = \"Threshold_Met\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Threshold_Met = coalesce(Threshold_Met,0)) %&gt;%\n  distinct() %&gt;%\n  group_by(Burden) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Communities_N = sum(Threshold_Met)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Burden = c(\"Climate Change: Ag Loss Risk\",\n         \"Climate Change: Flood Risk\",\n         \"Nature Deprivation\",\n         \"Air Pollution: PM2.5\",\n         \"Air Pollution: Traffic\",\n         \"Water Pollution: Wasetwater\",\n         \"Pollution: Hazardous Waste\",\n         \"Pollution: Underground Tanks\",\n         \"Pollution: Superfund Sites\",\n         \"Legacy Effects: Redlining\",\n         \"Pollution: Phosphate Mines\",\n         \"Pollution: Brownfield Sites\"))\n  \nggplot(under_over_burdens, aes(x = reorder(Burden, -Communities_N), y = Communities_N)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill = Burden), color = \"black\", stat = \"identity\") +\n  xlab(\"\\nEnvironmental Burden\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of Underserved Communities Benefiting from Projects\\n\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = rev) +\n  scale_y_continuous(position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of activities undertaken in these underserved communities\nYou can make additional maps to characterize communities based on the restoration activities. For example, we can map the restoration techniques of projects that benefited underserved communities. The maps generated below show the underserved communities benefiting from planting (green), oyster gardening (black), shoreline enhancement/stabilization (brown), and invasive species control/removal (blue) activities.\n\nunder_over_techniques &lt;- full_join(under_over, summaries2, by = 'ID') %&gt;%\n  rename(\"Restoration_Technique\" = \"Restoratio\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Restoration_Technique = coalesce(Restoration_Technique, \"None\"),\n         Projects_N = coalesce(Projects_N, 0),\n         Project_Costs = coalesce(Project_Costs, 0)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(ShorelineEnhance = sum(Restoration_Technique == \"Shoreline Stabilization/Enhancement\"),\n            VegetationBuffer = sum(Restoration_Technique == \"Vegetation Buffer\"),\n            Planting = sum(Restoration_Technique == \"Planting\"),\n            ReefConstruction = sum(Restoration_Technique == \"Reef Construction - Natural Materials\"),\n            OysterGardening = sum(Restoration_Technique == \"Oyster Gardening\"),\n            DebrisRemoval = sum(Restoration_Technique == \"Debris Removal\"),\n            InvasivesControl = sum(Restoration_Technique == \"Invasives Control/Removal - Vegetation\"),\n            Other = sum(Restoration_Technique == \"Other\"))\n\nmap_planting &lt;- under_over_techniques %&gt;%\n  filter(Planting &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  mapview(col.regions = \"green\", layer.name = \"Planting\")\n\nmap_oyster &lt;- under_over_techniques %&gt;%\n  filter(OysterGardening  &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  mapview(col.regions = \"black\", layer.name = \"Oyster Gardening\")\n\nmap_shore &lt;- under_over_techniques %&gt;%\n  filter(ShorelineEnhance &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  mapview(col.regions = \"brown\", layer.name = \"Shoreline Enhancement\")\n\nmap_invasives &lt;- under_over_techniques %&gt;%\n  filter(InvasivesControl  &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  mapview(col.regions = \"blue\", layer.name = \"Invasives Control\")\n\nsync(map_planting, map_oyster, map_shore, map_invasives)"
